TODO:

- Add normals to Cone!

- Double check the member variables that are vectors and points. Are the right things pointers? Why are the arguments all Vector&'s? Make sure the right things are pointers.

- Make new function "reset matrices," that resets all the matrices. Maybe like, you manually change anything that a given parameter affects, and then just call reset. How much downside is there to recalculating things?
